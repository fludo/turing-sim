# Turing-sim
Emulateur de Machine de Turing



Initial description and changelog :

-----------------------------
 || Turing machine emulator ||
 -----------------------------

 The goal of this project is to implement a system to emulate certain abstractions of Turing machines.
 The first step in this project would be to design a simple "programming language" for describing the
 behavior of a Turing machine and then implementing an interpreter for this language.
 The subsequent steps will involve writing simple modules that implement certain basic operations on
 Turing machines, implementing "compilers" for translating simple but more high-level languages to
 basic programs that can run on Turing machines, and building an easy-to-use user interface for
 interacting with the system.
